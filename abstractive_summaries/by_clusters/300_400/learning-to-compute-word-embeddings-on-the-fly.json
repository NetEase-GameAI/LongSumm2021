    "Word based language models suffer from the problem of rare or Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words.",
    "Learning representations for OOV words directly on the end task often results in poor representation.",
    "The alternative is to replace all the rare words with a single, unique representation (loss of information) or use character level models to obtain word representations (they tend to miss on the semantic relationship).",
    "The paper proposes to learn a network that can predict the representations of words using auxiliary data (referred to as definitions) such as dictionary definitions, Wikipedia infoboxes, the spelling of the word etc.",
    "The auxiliary data encoders are trained jointly with the end task to ensure that word representations align with the requirements of the end task.",
    "Approach  Given a rare word w, let d(w) = <x1, x2\u2026> denote its defination where xi are words.",
    "d(w) is fed to a defination reader network f (LSTM) and its last state is used as the defination embedding ed(w)  In case w has multiple definitions, the embeddings are combined using mean pooling.",
    "The approach can be extended to in-vocabulary words as well by using the definition embedding of such words to update their original embeddings.",
    "Experiments  Auxiliary data sources  Word definitions from WordNet  Spelling of words  The proposed approach was tested on following tasks:  Extractive Question Answering over SQuAD  Base model from Xiong et al. 2016  Entailment Prediction over SNLI corpus  Base models from Bowman et al.",
    "2015 and Chen et al. 2016  One Billion Words Language Modelling  For all the tasks, models using both spelling and dictionary (SD) outperformed the model using just one.",
    "While SD does not outperform the Glove model (with full vocabulary), it does bridge the performance gap significantly.",
    "Future Work  Multi-token words like \u201cSan Francisco\u201d are not accounted for now.",
    "The model does not handle the rare words which appear in the definition and just replaces them by the  token.",
    "Making the model recursive would be a useful addition."
