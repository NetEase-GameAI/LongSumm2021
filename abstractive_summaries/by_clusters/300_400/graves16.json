    "This paper proposes a neural architecture that allows to backpropagate gradients though a procedure that can go through a variable and adaptive number of iterations.",
    "These \"iterations\" for instance could be the number of times computations are passed through the same recurrent layer (connected to the same input) before producing an output, which is the case considered in this paper.",
    "This is essentially achieved by pooling the recurrent states and respective outputs computed by each iteration.",
    "The pooling mechanism is essentially the same as that used in the really cool Neural Stack architecture of Edward Grefenstette, Karl Moritz Hermann, Mustafa Suleyman and Phil Blunsom  [ref] .",
    "It relies on the introduction of halting units, which are sigmoidal units computed at each iteration and which gives a soft weight on whether the computation should stop at the current iteration.",
    "Crucially, the paper introduces a new ponder cost $P(x)$, which is a regularization cost that penalizes what is meant to be a smooth upper bound on the number of iterations $N(t)$ (more on that below).",
    "The paper presents experiment on RNNs applied on sequences where, at each time step t (not to be confused with what I'm calling computation iterations, which are indexed by n) in the sequence the RNN can produce a variable number $N(t)$ of intermediate states and outputs.",
    "These are the states and outputs that are pooled, to produce a single recurrent state and output for the time step t. During each of the $N(t)$ iterations at time step t, the intermediate states are connected to the same time-step-t input.",
    "After the $N(t)$ iterations, the RNN pools the $N(t)$ intermediate states and outputs, and then moves to the next time step $t+1$.",
    "To mark the transitions between time steps, an extra binary input is appended, which is 1 only for the first intermediate computation iteration.",
    "Results are presented on a variety of synthetic problems and a character prediction problem."
