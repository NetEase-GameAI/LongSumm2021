    "This workshop paper explores the problem of style transfer in natural language generation (NLG).",
    "One possible manifestation would be rewriting technical articles in an easy-to-understate manner.",
    "Challenges  Identifying relevant stylistic cues and using them to control text generation in NLG systems.",
    "Absence of a large amount of training data.",
    "Pitch  Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to disentangle the style from semantic content.",
    "Autoencoder model with two components - one for learning style and another for learning content.",
    "This allows for \u201cstyle\u201d component to be replaced while keeping the \u201ccontent\u201d component same, resulting in a style transfer.",
    "One way to think about this is - the encoder generates a 100-dimensional vector.",
    "In this, the first 50 entries, correspond to the \u201cstyle\u201d component and remaining to the \u201ccontent\u201d component.",
    "The proposal is that the loss function should be modified to include a cross-covariance term for ensuring disentanglement.",
    "I think one way of doing this is to have two loss functions:  The first loss function ensures that the input sentence is decoded properly into the target sentence.",
    "This loss is computed for each sentence.",
    "The second loss ensures that the first 50 entries across all the encoded represenations are are correlated.",
    "This loss operates at the batch level.",
    "The total loss is the weighted sum of these 2 losses.",
    "Possible Datasets  Complete works of Shakespeare  Wikpedia Kaggle dataset  Oxford Text Archive  Twitter data  Possible Metrics  Soundness - is the generated text entailed with the input sentence.",
    "Coherence - free of grammatical errors, proper word usage etc.",
    "Effectiveness - how effective was the style transfer  Since some of the metrics are subjective, human evaluators also need to be employed."
