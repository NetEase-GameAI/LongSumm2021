    "Semantic parsing is the problem of mapping natural language utterances into logical forms that can be executed on a Knowledge Base (KB).",
    "The paper presents a new approach to semantic parsing that uses paraphrasing to leverage the large amount of text which is not covered by the KB.",
    "Approach  Given an input utterance x, construct a set of logical forms Zx using a different kind of logical form templates.",
    "For each logical form z in Zx, generate a small set Cz, of canonical utterances using Freebase description of the type, entity and property involved in the logical form.",
    "Note: Both the steps above are performed with a small, simple set of deterministic rules which the authors found sufficient for their datasets.",
    "For each z in Z and each c in Cz, use a paraphrase model to score pairs (c, z) given x.",
    "The paraphrase model has two parts:  Association Model  For each pair of (x, c), the model goes through all spans of x and c and identifies pairs of potential paraphrases (associations).",
    "To determine the associations, the model uses  Phrase pairs from a phrase table, constructed using Paralex corpus.",
    "Linguistic features like lemma, POS tag and Wordnet derivations.",
    "During training, the model learns to weight the associations appropriately.",
    "Vector Space Model  Assign vector representations to x and c by averaging over the word2vec representations corresponding to the different words in these utterances.",
    "Estimate paraphrase score for (x, c) via weighted combination of their vector representations.",
    "The two paraphrase models are complementary to each other in terms of the information they capture.",
    "Training  Dataset  WEBQUESTIONS dataset - 5810 question answer pairs.",
    "FREE917 dataset - 917 questions (annoted with logical form).",
    "Learning  Given the question-answer pair (xi, yi), the objective function minimizes the log-likelihood of the correct answer along with the restriction of L1 regularization.",
    "Results  The proposed model improves the accuracy on WEBQUESTIONS by 12% and matches the best results on FREE917.",
    "Removing the association model results in a much larger degradation of performance as compared to removing the VS model.",
    "Error analysis suggests that the model:  can not handle temporal relations.",
    "suffers from ambiguity in entity recognition.",
    "counts multiple associations multiple times and assigns inflated scores to such associations.",
    "Comments  The core idea of using paraphrasing for semantic parsing seems promising and would further benefit from advanced models like skip-thought vectors which provide a more natural vector representation for the sentences, thereby helping to reduce the dependence on handcrafted features.",
    "This comment has been minimized.",
    "Sign in to view  Copy link  Quote reply  BrijeshKaria commented  Jan 20, 2018  Is there any good implementation of this available as open source?",
    "I am trying sempre which is based on this same concept.",
    "I am however stuck there with lack of good documentation about how to create paraphrase models for custom domain."
