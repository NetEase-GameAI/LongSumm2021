    "Notes  The paper presents a simple yet effective approach for transferring knowledge from a trained neural network (referred to as the teacher network) to a large, untrained neural network (referred to as the student network).",
    "The key idea is to use a function-preserving transformation that guarantees that for any given input, the output from the teacher network and the newly created student network would be the same.",
    "Link to an implementation  The approach works as follows - Let us say that the teacher network was represented by the transformation y = f(x, \u03b8) where \u03b8 refer to the parameters of the network.",
    "The task is to choose a new set of parameters \u03b8\u2019 for the student network g(x, \u03b8\u2019) such that for all x, f(x, \u03b8) = g(x, \u03b8\u2019)  To start, we can assume that f and g are composed of standard linear layers.",
    "Layer i and i+1 are represented by weights Wmxni and Wnxpi+1  We want to grow layer i to have q output units (where q > n) and layer i+1 to have q input units.",
    "The new weight matrix would be Umxqi and Uqxpi+1  The first q columns (rows) of Wi (Wi+1) would be copied as it is into Ui(Ui+1).",
    "For filling the remaining n-q slots, columns (rows) would be sampled randomly from Wi (Wi+1).",
    "Finally, each layer in Ui is scaled by dividing by the corresponding replication factor to ensure that the output value of function remains unchanged by the operation.",
    "Since convolutions can be seen as multiplication by a double block circulant matrix, the approach can be readily extended for convolutional networks.",
    "The benefits of using this approach are the following:  The newly created student network performs at least as good as the teacher network.",
    "Any changes to the network are guaranteed to be an improvement.",
    "It is safe to optimize all the parameters in the network.",
    "The variant discussed above is called the Net2WiderNet variant.",
    "There is another variant calledNet2DeeperNet that enables the network to grow in depth.",
    "In that case, a new matrix, U, initialized as the identity matrix, is added to the network.",
    "Note that unlike the Net2WiderNet, this approach would not work with arbitrary activation function between the layers.",
    "Strengths  The model can accelerate the training of neural networks, especially during development cycle when the designers try out different models.",
    "The approach could potentially be used in life-long learning systems where the model is trained over a stream of data and needs to grow over time.",
    "Limitations  The function preserving transformations need to be worked out manually.",
    "Extra care needs to be taken when operations like concatenation or batch norm are present."
