    "What  They compare the results of various models for pedestrian detection.",
    "The various models were developed over the course of ~10 years (2003-2014).",
    "They analyze which factors seemed to improve the results.",
    "They derive new models for pedestrian detection from that.",
    "Comparison: Datasets  Available datasets  INRIA: Small dataset.",
    "Diverse images.",
    "ETH: Video dataset.",
    "Stereo images.",
    "TUD-Brussels: Video dataset.",
    "Daimler: No color channel.",
    "Daimler stereo: Stereo images.",
    "Caltech-USA: Most often used.",
    "Large dataset.",
    "KITTI: Often used.",
    "Large dataset.",
    "Stereo images.",
    "All datasets except KITTI are part of the \"unified evaluation toolbox\" that allows authors to easily test on all of these datasets.",
    "The evaluation started initially with per-window (FPPW) and later changed to per-image (FPPI), because per-window skewed the results.",
    "Common evaluation metrics:  MR: Log-average miss-rate (lower is better)  AUC: Area under the precision-recall curve (higher is better)  Comparison: Methods  Families  They identified three families of methods: Deformable Parts Models, Deep Neural Networks, Decision Forests.",
    "Decision Forests was the most popular family.",
    "No specific family seemed to perform better than other families.",
    "There was no evidence that non-linearity in kernels was needed (given sophisticated features).",
    "Additional data  Adding (coarse) optical flow data to each image seemed to consistently improve results.",
    "There was some indication that adding stereo data to each image improves the results.",
    "Context  For sliding window detectors, adding context from around the window seemed to improve the results.",
    "E.g. context can indicate whether there were detections next to the window as people tend to walk in groups.",
    "Deformable parts  They saw no evidence that deformable part models outperformed other models.",
    "Multi-Scale models  Training separate models for each sliding window scale seemed to improve results slightly.",
    "Deep architectures  They saw no evidence that deep neural networks outperformed other models.",
    "(Note: Paper is from 2014, might have changed already?)",
    "Features  Best performance was usually achieved with simple HOG+LUV features, i.e. by converting each window into:  6 channels of gradient orientations  1 channel of gradient magnitude  3 channels of LUV color space  Some models use significantly more channels for gradient orientations, but there was no evidence that this was necessary to achieve good accuracy.",
    "However, using more different features (and more sophisticated ones) seemed to improve results.",
    "Their new model:  They choose Decisions Forests as their model framework (2048 level-2 trees, i.e. 3 thresholds per tree).",
    "They use features from the Integral Channels Features framework .",
    "(Basically just a mixture of common/simple features per window.)",
    "They add optical flow as a feature.",
    "They add context around the window as a feature.",
    "(A second detector that detects windows containing two persons.)",
    "Their model significantly improves upon the state of the art (from 34 to 22% MR on Caltech dataset).",
    "Overview of models developed over the years, starting with Viola Jones (VJ) and ending with their suggested model (Katamari-v1).",
