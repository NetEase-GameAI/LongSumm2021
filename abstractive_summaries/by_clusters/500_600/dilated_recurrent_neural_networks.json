    "What  They add a dilation factor to recurrent neural networks (e.g. LSTMs), similar to dilation in convolutions.",
    "This enables learning of long-term dependencies, prevents vanishing/exploding gradients and makes the networks sometimes more parallelizable.",
    "How  Dilation  Dilation d here simply means, that each timestep gets input from the d-th previous timestep.",
    "With d=1, this is identical to a normal reccurent network.",
    "With d=2 there is a gap of 1 between each timestep.",
    "They suggest to let the dilation exponentially increase per layer, e.g. 1, 2, 4, ...  Visualization:  Using dilation can make it possible to execute some steps of the RNN in parallel.",
    "The following visualization shows that:  The dilation may start at a value higher than 1.",
    "This however should be compensated before generating the output vector.",
    "To do that, output of the last layer at timestep t and t-1 has to be used.",
    "Visualization:  Memory capacity  They show that the memory capacity of dilated RNNs is better than in skip RNNs, i.e. the average path length in the network is shorter.",
    "Results  Copy-Task  This task involves copying of inputs.",
    "I.e. the network gets some integers at the start, then T={500, 1000} timesteps pass, then it has to output the input values.",
    "They use 9 layers with a dilation of up to 256.",
    "(This means that it is really almost raw copying of data for the network.)",
    "Dilated RNNs perform best here, followed by dilated GRUs and dilated LSTMs.",
    "All non-dilated networks resort to random guessing (i.e. fail to learn anything).",
    "MNIST  They predict classes on MNIST, where each image is turned into a 784-element vector.",
    "All networks, including competitors, can handle that task.",
    "They make the task harder by padding the vectors to 1000 and 2000 elements length.",
    "Then only their dilated networks, dilated (1d-)CNNs and RNNs with skip connections can handle the task.",
    "Their dilated RNNs learn faster the more layers they have.",
    "With 2 layers they learn nothing.",
    "With few layers they can sometimes also have major swings in accuracy during training.",
    "When increasing the minimum dilation, they find that they can drop layers and still achieve almost the same accuracy, leading to much faster training (wall-clock time).",
    "Training with minimum dilation 2 leads to same accuracy at half the training time.",
    "Language modelling  They test their models on Penn Treebank character predictions.",
    "Their models get beaten by LayerNorm HM-LSTM, HyperNetworks, Zoneout.",
    "They argue though that their models achieve the highest scores among models that do not use any normalization.",
    "Speaker identification from raw waveform  They train on VCTK.",
    "Their dilated models achieve much higher accuracy than non-dilated ones and can compete with models using MFCC features."
