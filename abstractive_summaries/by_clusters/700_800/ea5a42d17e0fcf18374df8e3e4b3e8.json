  "summary": [
    "Introduces a new global log-bilinear regression model which combines the benefits of both global matrix factorization and local context window methods.",
    "Global Matrix Factorization Methods  Decompose large matrices into low-rank approximations.",
    "eg - Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)  Limitations  Poor performance on word analogy task  Frequent words contribute disproportionately high to the similarity measure.",
    "Shallow, Local Context-Based Window Methods  Learn word representations using adjacent words.",
    "eg - Continous bag-of-words (CBOW) model and skip-gram model.",
    "Limitations  Since they do not operate directly on the global co-occurrence counts, they can not utilise the statistics of the corpus effectively.",
    "GloVe Model  To capture the relationship between words i and j, word vector models should use ratios of co-occurene probabilites (with other words k) instead of using raw probabilites themselves.",
    "In most general form:  F(wi, wj, wk~ ) = Pik/Pjk  We want F to encode information in the vector space (which have a linear structure), so we can restrict to the difference of wi and wj  F(wi - wj, wk~ ) = Pik/Pjk  Since right hand side is a scalar and left hand side is a vector, we take dot product of the arguments.",
    "F( (wi - wj)T, wk~ ) = Pik/Pjk  F should be invariant to order of the word pair i and j.  F(wiTwk~) = Pik  Doing further simplifications and optimisations (refer paper), we get cost function,  J = Sum (over all i, j pairs in the vocabulary)[wiTwk  + bi + bk - log(Xik)]2  f is a weighing function.",
    "f(x) = min((x/xmax)\u03b1, 1)  Typical values, xmax = 100 and \u03b1 = 3/4  b are the bias terms.",
    "Complexity  Depends on a number of non-zero elements in the input matrix.",
    "Upper bound by the square of vocabulary size  Since for shallow window-based approaches, complexity depends on |C| (size of the corpus), tighter bounds are needed.",
    "By modelling number of co-occurrences of words as power law function of frequency rank, the complexity can be shown to be proportional to |C|0.8  Evaluation  Tasks  Word Analogies  a is to b as c is to ___?",
    "Both semantic and syntactic pairs  Find closest d to wb - wc + wa (using cosine similarity)  Word Similarity  Named Entity Recognition  Datasets  Wikipedia Dumps - 2010 and 2014  Gigaword5  Combination of Gigaword5 and Wikipedia2014  CommonCrawl  400,000 most frequent words considered from the corpus.",
    "Hyperparameters  Size of context window.",
    "Whether to distinguish left context from right context.",
    "f - Word pairs that are d words apart contribute 1/d to the total count.",
    "xmax = 100  \u03b1 = 3/4  AdaGrad update  Models Compared With  Singular Value Decomposition  Continous Bag-Of-Words  Skip-Gram  Results  Glove outperforms all other models significantly.",
    "Diminishing returns for vectors larger than 200 dimensions.",
    "Small and asymmetric context windows (context window only to the left) works better for syntactic tasks.",
    "Long and symmetric context windows (context window to both the sides) works better for semantic tasks.",
    "Syntactic task benefited from larger corpus though semantic task performed better with Wikipedia instead of Gigaword5 probably due to the comprehensiveness of Wikipedia and slightly outdated nature of Gigaword5.",
    "Word2vec\u2019s performance decreases if the number of negative samples increases beyond about 10.",
    "For the same corpus, vocabulary, and window size GloVe consistently achieves better results, faster.",
    "This comment has been minimized.",
    "Sign in to view  Copy link  Quote reply  Liskutin commented  Mar 12, 2019  I know its old post, but I have a question.",
    "If the model is basically trying to reconstruct the big co-occurrence matrix [well in the paper they said they transform that into probability ratios matrix, i guess], is the model reconstructing the matrix line by line or word by word?"
