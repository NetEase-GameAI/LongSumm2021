    "Adversarial patch Brown, Man\u00e9 et al., arXiv 2017  Today\u2019s paper choice is short and sweet, but thought provoking nonetheless.",
    "To a man with a hammer (sticker), everything looks like a hammer.",
    "We\u2019ve seen a number of examples of adversarial attacks on image recognition systems, where the perturbations are designed to be subtle and hard to detect.",
    "But what if you don\u2019t mind the alteration being obvious to the human eye?",
    "Brown et al. show how to create stickers (image patches) that can be added to a scene, and force a classifier into reporting a class of the attacker\u2019s choosing.",
    "We present a method to create universal, robust, targeted adversarial image patches in the real world.",
    "The patches are universal because they can be used to attack any scene, robust because they work under a wide variety of transformations, and targeted because they can cause a classifier to output any target class.",
    "Here\u2019s an example of a printable sticker designed to cause classification as a toaster.",
    "And here\u2019s the sticker placed on a table next to a banana.",
    "The sticker causes the previously reported class banana (97% confidence) to become toaster with 99% confidence.",
    "Because this patch is scene-independent, it allows attackers to create a physical-world attack without prior knowledge of the lighting conditions, camera angle, type of classifier being attacked, or even the other items within the scene\u2026 Additionally, because the attack uses a large perturbation, the existing defense techniques which focus on defending against small perturbations may not be robust to larger perturbations such as these.",
    "Why does it work?",
    "An image may contain several items, but a classifier outputting only one target output has to determine which is the most \u2018salient\u2019 item in the frame.",
    "The adversarial patch exploits this by producing inputs that scream out \u201cI\u2019m an X\u201d for some value of X.",
    "Generating adversarial patches  The patch application operator , A, takes an input a patch p, image x, location l, and transformations t. It first applies the transformations to the patch, and then applies the transformed patch to the image x at location l.  If we\u2019re targeting an output class  , then we can train to optimise the objective function  Where X is a training set of images, T is a distribution over transformations of the patch, and L is a distribution over locations in the image.",
    "This departs from most prior work on adversarial perturbations in the fact that this perturbation is universal in that it works for any background.",
    "Experimental results  The experiment compares four different variations of patches, targeting recognition of an image as a toaster.",
    "Five different ImageNet models are used: inceptionv3, resnet50, xception, VGG16, and VGG19.",
    "The control is a simple picture of a toaster!",
    "The white box single trains a patch and evaluates it on a single model.",
    "The white box ensemble jointly trains a single patch across all five models, and is evaluated by averaging the win rate across them.",
    "The blackbox attack jointly trains a single patch across four of the models, and then evaluates against the fifth (held out) model.",
    "The white box models are very successful even when only 10% of the overall image size.",
    "They clearly capture the essence of toaster much better than the picture of an actual toaster!!",
    "The adversarial patches above reveal their target class to a human observer.",
    "The authors also experimented with disguising the patches using a tie-dye pattern and also applying a peace sign mask.",
    "These look nothing like a toaster to me anymore, but still do pretty well at larger relative sizes:  Many ML models operate without human validation of every input and thus malicious attackers may not be concerned with the imperceptibility of their attacks.",
    "Even if humans are able to notice these patches, they may not understand the intent of the patch and instead view it as a form of art.",
    "This work shows that focusing only on defending against small perturbations is insufficient, as large, local perturbations can also break classifiers."
