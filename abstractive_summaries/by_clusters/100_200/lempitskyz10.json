    "They introduce the concept of counting in images by predicting a density map.",
    "Their training only requires dot annotations on the center of objects.",
    "Each dot is expanded to a gaussian to form a density.",
    "A model is trained to predict this density and then the total count is recovered by integrating over the resulting density map.",
    "They create a function to produce the density based on quantized dense SIFT features  [ref]  from every pixel in the image.",
    "A simple version of the definition of $F$ is shown below.",
    "Each pixel becomes an $x_p$ vector which is used to train and model to implement the function $F$.",
    "$$\\forall p \\in I, \\hspace{10pt } F(p|w) = wx_p $$  The obtained quantized dense SIFT features using the [VLFEAT]( [url]"
