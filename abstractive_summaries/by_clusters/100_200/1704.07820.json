    "In this work they take a different approach to the GAN model  [ref] .",
    "In the traditionally GAN model a neural network is trained to up-sample from random noise in a feed forward fashion to generate samples from the data distribution.",
    "This work instead iteratively permutes an image of random noise similar to Artistic Style Transfer  [ref] .",
    "The image is permuted in order to fool a set of discriminators.",
    "To obtain the set of discriminators each is trained starting from random noise until some max $t$ step.",
    "1.",
    "At first a discriminator is trained to discriminate between the true data and random noise .",
    "2.",
    "Images is then permuted using gradients which aim to fool the discriminator and included in the data distribution as a negative example.",
    "3.",
    "The discriminator is trained on the true data + random noise + fake data from the previous steps  The images generated at each step are shown below:   [url]"
