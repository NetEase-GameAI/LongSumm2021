    "Musketeer: all for one, one for all in data processing systems \u2013 Gog et al. 2015  Musketeer gives you portability of data processing workflows across across data processing systems.",
    "It can even analyse your workflow and recommend the best system to run it on, as well as combining systems for different parts of the workflow.",
    "This is important since, as we saw yesterday in part  1 , no one system is universally best across all workload sizes and varieties.",
    "It  works by introducing a DAG-based intermediate representation (IR) and a translator from existing workflow specifications into this IR (all for one).",
    "The IR is then analysed and optimised and efficient code is generated for the target back-end system (one for all).",
    "You\u2019ll find the paper at the link above, and the open source project at  [url]"
