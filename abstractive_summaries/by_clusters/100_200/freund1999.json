    "This extends perceptrons  [ref]  but uses what is known as the Hinge loss (aka SVM loss):  $$J_i(w) = max(0,\\gamma -y\\_i f(x\\_i))$$  Where $\\gamma$ is the margin.",
    "$J_i(w)$ is the error given some weight $w$ parameters.",
    "$x_i$ and $y_i$ are a training example and correct label.",
    "$f(x_i)$ is the perceptron function we are trying learn the best weights for."
