    "If you cluster points to randomly define classes (e.g. random k-means) you can then sample tasks of 2 or 3 classes and use them to train a model.",
    "Where does the extra information come from?",
    "The metric space used for k-means asserts specific distances.",
    "The intuition why this works is that it is useful model initialization for downstream tasks.",
