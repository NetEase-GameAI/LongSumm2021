    "Diplomat: Using Delegations to Protect Community Repositories \u2013 Kuppusamy et al. 2016  Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, Python Package Index (PyPI), RubyGems, and SourceForge provide an easy way for a developer to disseminate software\u2026 [they] are immensely popular and collectively serve more than a billion packages per year.",
    "Unfortunately, the popularity of these repositories also makes them an attractive target to hackers\u2026 Major repositories run by Adobe, Apache, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo, GitHub, GNU Savannah, Linux, Microsoft, npm, Opera, PHP, RedHat, RubyGems, SourceForge, and WordPress have all been compromised at least once.",
    "This is a topic of immediate importance.",
    "Diplomat is a practical security system for community repositories that combines immediate project registration (adding new projects happens all the time with popular repositories) and compromise-resilience.",
