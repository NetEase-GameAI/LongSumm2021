    "What  They suggest a method to get cumulative/aggregated embedding from a sequence of embeddings (i.e get a single face embedding vector from a video).",
    "How  Use attention mechanism to weight embeddings in a sequence.",
    "They suggest two options:  Single attention block \u2013 Universal face feature quality measurement.",
    "where f_k = embedding for k-th image in a sequence, a_k = obtained weight corresponded to k-th embedding  Trainable parameter is: q (shape = embedding size x 1)  Cascaded two attention blocks \u2013 Content-aware aggregation.",
    "This q^1 replaces the q in above formula that computes coefficients a_k.",
    "Trainable parameters are: W (shape = embeddings size x embeddings size), b (shape = embedding size x 1).",
    "Face embedder (could be any CNN) and \"Attention blocks\" can be trained together in end-to-end manner or separately one-by-one.",
    "Training procedure:  For verification problem they used siamese structure with contrastive loss.",
    "For identification problem they used softmax and cross-entropy as loss function.",
    "No recurrent blocks, but still input size independent.",
    "Coefficients a (from the first attention block) strongly correlates with face quality and it's usefulness for recognition.",
    "Results  Shows better results than combining a single embedding by taking mean, median, l2/cos closest, etc.",
    "Shows state-of-the-art performance on YouTubeFaces and IJB-A datasets."
