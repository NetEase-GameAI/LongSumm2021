    "An empirical analysis of anonymity in Zcash Kappos et al., USENIX Security\u201918  As we\u2019ve seen before, in practice Bitcoin offers little in the way of anonymity .",
    "Zcash on the other hand was carefully designed with privacy in mind.",
    "It offers strong theoretical guarantees concerning privacy.",
    "So in theory users of Zcash can remain anonymous.",
    "In practice though it depends on the way those users interact with Zcash.",
    "Today\u2019s paper choice, \u2018An empirical analysis of anonymity in Zcash\u2019 studies how identifiable transaction participants are in practice based on the 2,242,847 transactions in the blockchain at the time of the study.",
    "We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.",
    "The analysis also provides some interesting insights into who is using Zcash and for what as well.",
    "Founders and miners combined account for around 66% of the value drawn from the shielded pool.",
    "The code for the analysis is available online at  [url]"
