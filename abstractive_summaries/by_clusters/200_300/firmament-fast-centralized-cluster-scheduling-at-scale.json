    "Firmament: Fast, centralized cluster scheduling at scale Gog et al. OSDI\u2019 16  Updated link to point to official usenix hosted version  As this paper demonstrates very well, cluster scheduling is a tricky thing to get right at scale.",
    "It sounds so simple on the surface: \u201chere are some new jobs/tasks \u2013 where should I run them?\u201d Of course the slightly more nuanced question, and where the troubles begin, is \u201cwhere should I run them in order to optimize for this objective, given these constraints\u2026?\u201d Typically you have a trade-off between distributed schedulers that can operate at scale and make fast decisions, and a centralized scheduler that can make higher quality decisions (e.g, improve utilisation, load balance, or whatever else your policy dictates) but struggles to make those decisions quickly enough as workload scales.",
    "What we have here is Firmament, a new centralised scheduler that combines high-quality placements on a par with advanced centralized schedulers, and the speed and scale of a distributed scheduler.",
    "It comes from a strong team of researchers across Cambridge, MIT, and Google, and is available in open source at  [url]"
