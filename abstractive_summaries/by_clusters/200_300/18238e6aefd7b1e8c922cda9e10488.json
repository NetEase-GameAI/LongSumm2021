    "The paper introduces GuessWhat - a two-player guessing game where the goal is to locate an object in a rich image scene.",
    "The game is used to produce a large scale dataset of visual question-answer pairs on the image.",
    "The paper also describes three tasks based on the game and provides a neural architecture based baselines for each task.",
    "GuessWhat?!",
    "Game  One player, called as the oracle, is randomly assigned an object in the given image.",
    "The second player, called as the questioner, tries to locate the object, given just the image.",
    "The questioner can ask a series of questions about the object and the oracle can reply in \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"not applicable\".",
    "Once the questioner is confident of having identified the image, the oracle presents a list of objects to the questioner to choose from.",
    "A small penalty is added, every time a question is asked, so as to encourage informative questions only.",
    "Dataset  A filtered subset of images from MSCOCO is used as the image set.",
    "Two separate tasks create on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) - for the role of oracle and questioner.",
    "Data was post processed -- both manually and using AMT -- to account for things like spelling mistakes and validation.",
    "Final dataset comprises of 150K thousand human game iterations with 800K question-answer pairs on 60K images.",
    "Dataset is available at  [url]"
