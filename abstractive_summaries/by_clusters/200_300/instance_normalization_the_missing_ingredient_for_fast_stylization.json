    "What  Style transfer between images works - in its original form - by iteratively making changes to a content image, so that its style matches more and more the style of a chosen style image.",
    "That iterative process is very slow.",
    "Alternatively, one can train a single feed-forward generator network to apply a style in one forward pass.",
    "The network is trained on a dataset of input images and their stylized versions (stylized versions can be generated using the iterative approach).",
    "So far, these generator networks were much faster than the iterative approach, but their quality was lower.",
    "They describe a simple change to these generator networks to increase the image quality (up to the same level as the iterative approach).",
    "How  In the generator networks, they simply replace all batch normalization layers with instance normalization layers.",
    "Batch normalization normalizes using the information from the whole batch, while instance normalization normalizes each feature map on its own.",
    "Equations  Let H = Height, W = Width, T = Batch size  Batch Normalization:  Instance Normalization  They apply instance normalization at test time too (identically).",
    "Results  Same image quality as iterative approach (at a fraction of the runtime).",
    "One content image with two different styles using their approach:"
