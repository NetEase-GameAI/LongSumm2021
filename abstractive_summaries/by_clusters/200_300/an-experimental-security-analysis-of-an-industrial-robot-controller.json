    "An experimental security analysis of an industrial robot controller Quarta et al., IEEE Security and Privacy 2017  This is an industrial robot:  The International Federation of Robotics forecasts that, by 2018, approximately 1.3 million industrial robot units will be employed in factories globally, and the international market value for \u201crobotized\u201d systems is approximately 32 billion USD.",
    "In all of their forms, robots are complex automation devices that heavily interact with the physical world\u2026  Most of these control systems were born in an era when they were assumed to be isolated from the network, but are now gaining new interconnections.",
    "And hey, guess what:  Unfortunately, even a simple Shodan query shows that sometimes industrial robots are exposed on the Internet without being properly secured.",
    "In this paper, the authors undertake a systematic analysis of the attack surface and potential impacts of cyber attacks against industrial robots.",
    "Their findings are sadly not surprising, yet at the same time some of the things you\u2019re about to read may leave you open-mouthed in disbelief.",
    "It\u2019s a perfect case study in how not to do things!",
    "Welcome to Industry 4.0 and the world of connected robots  Industrial robots are \u201cconnected\u201d primarily for programming and maintenance purposes \u2013 a use case specified by ISO standards.",
    "For instance, in a large car production plant developed by KUKA Robotics, all the 259 robots are connected to central control and monitoring systems.",
    "The industrial robot ecosystem is blooming, there are \u201cRobot Web Service\u201d HTTP REST APIs, a Robot App Store (  [url]"
