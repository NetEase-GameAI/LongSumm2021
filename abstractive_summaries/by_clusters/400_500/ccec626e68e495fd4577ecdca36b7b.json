    "The paper proposes a new RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture that can improve the performance of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems.",
    "RNN Encoder-Decoder  Model consists of two RNNs  Encoder  Learns to encode a variable-length input sequence into a fixed-length vector representation.",
    "Decoder  Learns to decode a given fixed-length vector representation into a variable-length target sequence.",
    "Two networks are trained jointly to maximise the conditional probability of the target sequence given the input source sequence.",
    "Trained model can be used to:  generate a target sequence, given an input sequence.",
    "score a given pair of input and output sequences.",
    "Hidden Unit that adaptively remembers and forgets.",
    "Hidden unit updated to have a  reset gate that adaptively drop any hidden state information that it finds irrelevant.",
    "update gate that controls how much information from the previous state to carry over.",
    "Each hidden unit has separate reset and update gates which improve the memory capacity and makes it easier to train.",
    "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)  In the phrase-based SMT framework, the translation model is factorised into the translation probabilities of matching phrases in the source and target sentences.",

    "Adadelta and SGD  Observations  Train the model to translate an English phrase to French phrase.",
    "Using the model to score phrase pairs in the standard phrase-based SMT system improves the translation performance.",
    "Train a CSLM (Continuous Space Language Model) and compare phrase scores from trained model with those given by CSLM.",
    "RNN Encoder\u2013Decoder is better at capturing the linguistic regularities in the phrase table.",
    "RNN Encoder-Decoder learns a continuous space representation for phrases that preserves both the semantic and syntactic structure.",

    "Sign in to view  Copy link  Quote reply  varunjanga commented  Apr 27, 2017  Hi shahbazsyed, if I understand it correctly input sequence can be variable length sequence of words which will be provided as an input to encoder to output fixed-length vector representation which is basically some fixed length(say 128) vector of numbers."
