    "A key idea pushed in this paper is that a value function represents semantic knowledge.",
    "Indeed, they state, \u201cA value function asks a question\u2013what will the cumulative reward be?\u2013and an approximate value function provides an answer to that question\u201d.",
    "Accordingly, they introduce Generalized Value Functions (GVFs), a construct to expand the knowledge that value functions can encapsulate to make them capable of representing knowledge about the world.",
    "A GVF is parameterized with four functions, a policy, pseudo-reward function, pseudo-terminal reward function, and pseudo-termination function, called question functions.",
    "They introduce Horde, an architecture for learning 1 or more approximate GVFs in parallel, where each \u201cdemon\u201d of the Horde is responsible for learning a piece of knowledge that contributes to the whole.",
    "Approximate GVFs can be learned off-policy.",
    "The paper uses GQ($\\lambda$) to train each demon, and hence a feature vector $\\phi$, behavior policy $b$, and eligibilty trace function $\\lambda$ must be specified; these are collectively called answer functions, since they are used to numerically find the value of approximate GVFs (answering the \u201cquestion\u201d).",
    "They show that a physical robot with many sensors is able to learn to predict how many steps it can go before needing to stop before hitting a wall (via 1 \u201cpredictive\u201d demon, i.e., a demon that seeks to accurately \u201cpredict\u201d the cumulative return by learning the approximate GVF for a given policy).",
    "The robot also uses 8 control demons to learn to separately maximize returns for \u201cmaxing out\u201d 8 different sensors.",
    "Finally, they trained 1 control demon to learn a light-seeking behavior.",
    "Recently, Barreto, et.",
    "al 2017 developed the ideas of successor features (SF), a value function representation that decouples environment dynamics from the reward function.",
    "They use it to show transfer between tasks.",
    "They discuss how their method is a special case of a GVF, but that it provides a method for \u201cselecting\u201d pseudo-rewards.",
    "This paper differs from the options framework in that options essentially define a hierarchy of policy abstractions.",
    "The authors note that GVFs could be combined with this approach, however."
